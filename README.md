###### Purpose:

White ginger is commonly grown in many places in Hawaii, like in the wild and in gardens. It is grown as a decorative plant for homes, for the flower’s strong scent, and for lei’s or haku’s.
##### To Grow:

White ginger could be grown just from a piece of the plant's root or a section of the plant's root and stock. It takes a few months for it to start growing stalks and blooms in summer for around 4-6 weeks. This plant likes shade and plenty of water, and should have a maximum 2 hours of sun.
